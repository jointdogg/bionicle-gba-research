# bionicle-gba-research

I figured I should probably make this stuff available somewhere, so: here are all of my reference files for Lego Bionicle GBA (2001). I wrote these for my own personal use, so hopefully they aren't too impenetrable. If, reading through them, you start to suspect that I don't really know what I'm doing: you're right. Part of the reason I'm posting these is so that if someone more competent comes along they'll have a base to work off of.

`decompiled.gzf` is a Ghidra ZIP file of a decompiled ROM. You should be able to simply import it into Ghidra -- let me know if you can't. I have all the reverse engineering experience of an egg, but I've identified and named a few key functions and datablocks that you might find useful.

All the other files have their own mini-readme at the top of the document.
