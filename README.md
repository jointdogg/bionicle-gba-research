# bionicle-gba-research

I figured I should probably make this stuff available somewhere, so: here are all of my reference files for Lego Bionicle GBA (2001). I wrote these for my own personal use, so hopefully they aren't too impenetrable. If, reading through them, you start to suspect that I don't really know what I'm doing: you're right. Part of the reason I'm posting these is so that if someone more competent comes along they'll have a base to work off of.

If you have any questions, DM me on Discord: joint-Dogg666#7447
